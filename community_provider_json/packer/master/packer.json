There are two available variables: Script, which is the path to the script to run, and Vars, which is the list of environment_vars, if configured. If you choose to set this option, make sure that the first element in the array is the shell program you want to use (for example, \"sh\" or \"/usr/local/bin/zsh\" or even \"powershell.exe\" although anything other than a flavor of the shell command language is not explicitly supported and may be broken by assumptions made within Packer). It's worth noting that if you choose to try to use shell-local for Powershell or other Windows commands, the environment variables will not be set properly for your environment.  For backwards compatibility, execute_command will accept a string instead of an array of strings. If a single string or an array of strings with only one element is provided, Packer will replicate past behavior by appending your execute_command to the array of strings [\"sh\", \"-c\"]. For example, if you set \"execute_command\": \"foo bar\", the final execute_command that Packer runs will be [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"foo bar\"]. If you set \"execute_command\": [\"foo\", \"bar\"], the final execute_command will remain [\"foo\", \"bar\"].

It's worth noting that if you choose to try to use shell-local for Powershell or other Windows commands, the environment variables will not be set properly for your environment.  For backwards compatibility, execute_command will accept a string instead of an array of strings.

For example, if you set \"execute_command\": \"foo bar\", the final execute_command that Packer runs will be [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"foo bar\"].
